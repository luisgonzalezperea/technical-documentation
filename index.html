            <p>The smallest React example looks like this:</p>
            <code>const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
                root.render(Hello, world!);</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Introducing_JSX">
            <header>Introducing JSX</header>
            <p>This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.
                It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to
                describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the
                full power of JavaScript.
                JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section. Below, you
                can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.
            </p>
            <code>const element = Hello, world!;</code>
            <li>React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are
                handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.</li>
            <li>We split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn’t required, when doing this, we also
                recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of automatic semicolon insertion.</li>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Rendering_elements">
            <header>Rendering elements</header>
            <p>An element describes what you want to see on the screen:</p>
            <code>const element = Hello, world;</code>
            <li>One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of “components”. We will introduce
                components in the next section. Elements are what components are “made of”, and we encourage you to read
                this section before jumping ahead.</li>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Components_and_props">
            <header>Components and props</header>
            <p>Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and
                return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.</p>
            <p>The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:</p>
            <code>function Welcome(props) {...}</code>
            <p>Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:</p>
            <code>const element = div;</code>
            <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Always start component names with a capital letter.
                React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example,
                div represents an HTML div tag, but
                Welcome represents a component and requires Welcome to be in scope.
                To learn more about the reasoning behind this convention, please read JSX In Depth.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="State_and_lifecycle">
            <header>State and lifecycle</header>
            <p>Consider the ticking clock example from one of the previous sections. In Rendering Elements, we have only
                learned one way to update the UI. We call root.render() to change the rendered output:</p>
            <code>const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));...</code>
            <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In React apps, whether a component is stateful or stateless is
                considered an implementation detail of the component that may change over time. You can use stateless
                components inside stateful components, and vice versa.</p>
            <p>This is commonly called a “top-down” or “unidirectional” data flow. Any state is always owned by some
                specific component, and any data or UI derived from that state can only affect components “below” them
                in the tree.
                If you imagine a component tree as a waterfall of props, each component’s state is like an additional
                water source that joins it at an arbitrary point but also flows down.
                To show that all components are truly isolated, we can create an App component that renders three
                Clock S:
            </p>
            <p>Neither parent nor child components can know if a certain component is stateful or stateless, and they
                shouldn’t care whether it is defined as a function or a class.</p>
            <li>We also can’t display the BoilingVerdict from Calculator. The Calculator doesn’t know the current
                temperature because it is hidden inside the TemperatureInput.</li>
            <li>It returns an empty string on an invalid temperature, and it keeps the output rounded to the third
                decimal place.</li>
            <code>function App() { return (...); }</code>
    </main>
